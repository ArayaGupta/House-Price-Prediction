# üè† House Price Prediction Project

This is a machine learning project to predict house prices using the California Housing dataset.

##  What I did:
- Explored the data using graphs like histograms and heatmaps
- Trained three ML models: Random Forest, Linear Regression, and XGBoost
- Compared the models using MAE, RMSE, and R¬≤ Score
- Tuned the Random Forest model using GridSearchCV for better performance
- Found the most important features that affect house prices
- Plotted actual vs predicted prices to check how well the model works

##  Files included:
- `house_price_prediction.ipynb` ‚Äì The full notebook with code, graphs, models, and results
- `README.md` ‚Äì This file that explains the project in simple words

##  Tools used:
- Python
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
